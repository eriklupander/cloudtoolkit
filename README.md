# Go Cloud Toolkit
#### WORK IN PROGRESS!!!!!
Strongly opinionated little toolkit for integrating a Go-based Microservice in a "typical" Spring Cloud / Netflix OSS landscape

This "cloud toolkit" is just a bit of glue around other 3rd party libraries for convenience for my own projects, but might be useful for others too. For more complete Go microservices toolkits, see go-kit.

### Supported integrations

* Hystrix through go-hystrix
* AMQP client through amqp (TODO link)
* Zipkin / Opentracing through go-opentracing (TODO link)
* Logging through Logrus (TODO link)
* Eureka (through my own little Eureka library)
* OAuth token verification
